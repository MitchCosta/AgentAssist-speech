Cisco constantly reviews and improves the Cisco Meeting Server and the Cisco Meeting App to ensure the best quality of video and meeting experience. The latest version will always be recommended as it contains the most up-to-date improvements and bug-fixes. Refer to theCisco Meeting App WebRTC Important Informationfor release information, bug fixes and open issues.', '1. currently version 2.4.0, as of 20/Sep/2018', 'Google Chrome is the platform for the WebRTC app to run and all the video processing is done within the web browser. Therefore it is crucial that Chrome is maintained up-to-date. This is because many WebRTC media issues are being resolved on an ongoing basis in Chrome4. Hence, it is recommened that WebRTC users keep the version of Chrome up-to-date.', 'Microsoft Windows is the platform for Google Chrome to run. Chrome will access Windows APIs to render graphics, process video contents and capture screen for the presentation content channel. Older versions of Windows generally lack support of the underlying hardware to deliver high quality video. For example, on Windows 7, Chrome disabled the use of the hardware H.264 video decoder due to issues on the Windows platform5.', '2Currently Windows 10 (April 2018 Update, version 1803), as of 07/Sep/2018', '3Currently version 69, as of 07/Sep/2018', '4One example is tracked asCSCvg16170, where Chrome fixed the presentation quality problem in version 66 and above.', '5https://codereview.chromium.org/1969673002/', 'Google Chrome will by default attempt to use hardware acceleration on Windows. This means some, or all video processing is offloaded to the graphics card instead of the CPU. This generally results in faster video encoding/decoding with reduced CPU usage, which would conserve power and free up the CPU for other tasks. In this case, the graphics driver is the software interface for Windows to take advantage of the hardware graphics card. Using the latest graphics driver from the graphics card vendor (Intel, AMD, NVidia, etc.) would normally provide the best result while using hardware encoding/decoding for WebRTC video.', 'H.264 should be the default unless instructed by a Cisco Support representative. Meeting Server can optionally use the VP8 video codec to work around some hardware and network issues, but H.264 usually delivers higher quality.', 'Depending on the graphics card hardware and driver, hardware-accelerated video encoding/decoding may be partially or fully supported by the graphics card. When hardware decoding is used, it will typically allow decoding video higher than 720p resolution. This should be default unless certain hardware is known to produce lower quality video.', 'The connections from the computer running Meeting App to Meeting Server should have QoS policies in place to prioritise audio and video traffic in periods of network congestion.\xa0 Wireless networks can be more “jittery” than wired networks. Therefore wired connections are preferable if available.', 'There are some general network requirements from Cisco for real-time audio and video (between any video endpoint device, including Meeting App and Meeting Server):', 'In addition, when sending and receiving presentation, a minimum of 500 kbps guaranteed bandwidth is required for the presentation alone to/from the WebRTC app. You cannot achieve good quality presentation share at lower bandwidths.', 'The difference between the presentation sender’s resolution and receiver’s resolution is very important. If the sender is sending its desktop at 4K resolution (8M pixels) but the receiver is only receiving at 720p (0.9M pixels), the presentation video will be scaled down to 1/8 of its original size and this is likely to cause significant softening of the picture, any text will likely to be completely unreadable. On the other hand, if the sender is presentation at 1080p and the receiver is receiving in 1080p full-screen, then there will be no degradation due to downscaling.', 'By default, the receiving WebRTC app will show both main video and presentation in a stacked layout. To improve sharpness of the content in the presentation video, it is recommend switching to the “presentation only” layout on your app, as it will make the best use of your browser tab’s viewing size.', 'Transition effects and animations on desktop (such as Windows Aero effects) or in applications (such as PowerPoint) should be minimized or avoided to improve the overall experience on the receiver. This is due the fact that fast movements are not optimized for the sharpness-focused presentation video. In extreme cases sharing a video stream within the presentation video will have significant framerate drops and macroblocking.
